## Introduction

In this project I have data collected from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. Data has label that identifying the quality of the activity.
Testing dataset doesn't have labels of activity quality. I have to mark testing dataset with activity labels using trayning dataset.

## Getting and cleaning data

To make this work, I decided to use caret package. Then I load data from datasets.
